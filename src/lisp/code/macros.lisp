;;; CASE-BODY returns code for all the standard "case" macros.  Name is the
;;; macro name, and keyform is the thing to case on.  Multi-p indicates whether
;;; a branch may fire off a list of keys; otherwise, a key that is a list is
;;; interpreted in some way as a single key.  When multi-p, test is applied to
;;; the value of keyform and each key for a given branch; otherwise, test is
;;; applied to the value of keyform and the entire first element, instead of
;;; each part, of the case branch.  When errorp, no t or otherwise branch is
;;; permitted, and an ERROR form is generated.  When proceedp, it is an error
;;; to omit errorp, and the ERROR form generated is executed within a
;;; RESTART-CASE allowing keyform to be set and retested.
